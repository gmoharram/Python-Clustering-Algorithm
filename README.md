# Python-Clustering-Algorithm
This is a basic k-means clustering algorithm implemented in python. The main file is [clusteringSelf.py](https://github.com/gmoharram/Python-Clustering-Algorithm/blob/main/clusteringSelf.py). Given an (excel)file with the training data, where each row represents a single data point, the algorithm calculates the positions of the k centroids, the centroid belonging to each data point, the amount of data points at each centroid and the clustering loss function value for our obtained fit.
